# RAD-Q
This repository contains the supplementary code for TMLR paper [On the Low-Rank Parametrization of Reward Models for Controlled Language Generation](https://openreview.net/forum?id=cjRsEGLT8B). 

## Implementation Credit
The code was build based on the code of [Reward-Augmented Decoding: Efficient Controlled Text Generation With a Unidirectional Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09520): https://github.com/r-three/RAD.
